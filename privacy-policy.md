5. Policy for Children

We do not knowingly collect or use any personal information from children (we define "children" as minors younger than 13, in certain cases, this age may be higher due to local regulatory requirements). We do not knowingly allow children to use our service. If you are a parent and become aware that your child has provided us with information, please contact us at 19bcs2410@gmail.com

Although we work to protect the security of your information, please be aware that no method of transmitting information over the internet is completely secure.

7. Data Retention

We retain your information for as long as it is necessary to provide you with the services. Where we do not need your information to provide the service to you, we retain it only for so long as we have a legitimate business purpose in keeping such information. In some cases, we retain your information for longer, if doing so is necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, or is otherwise permitted or required by applicable laws and regulations.

8. Your rights

You have a right to know what information we hold about you, and to access it. You have a right to have incomplete, incorrect, unnecessary or outdated information updated. You have the right to request that your information be erased, and to obtain a copy of your information. You have the right to object to or restrict processing in certain circumstances, such as where you believe the information is inaccurate or the processing activity is unlawful.

Please note that in some circumstances, we may not be able to fully comply with your request, such as if it is frivolous or extremely impractical, if it jeopardizes the rights of others, or if it is not required by law, but in those circumstances, we will still respond to notify you of such a decision.

9. Updating this Privacy Policy

ShareOn reserves the right to change, modify, or update this privacy policy at any time. Any changes to this privacy policy will become effective when we post the revised privacy policy on ShareOno. We will update the "Last Updated" date at the top this privacy policy, which reflects the effective date of such policy. Your continued use of the service following these changes means that you accept the revised privacy policy. If you do not agree to the updated policy, you must stop accessing or using Shareon.
